## Abstract
This document describes the vSphere Automation Python SDK samples that use the vSphere Automation python client library. Additionally, some of the samples demonstrate the combined use of the vSphere Automation and vSphere APIs. To support this combined use, the vSphere Automation Python SDK samples require the vSphere Management SDK packages (pyVmomi) to be installed on the client. The examples have been developed to work with python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
#### Required:
The below items need to be installed for running the samples:
* Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5
* vCenter Server 6.5
* [Installing SDK and 3rd party libraries]

### Running the Samples
Please refer to running a vcenter sample for detailed steps to run a vCenter sample. 
Please refer to running a workflow sample for detailed steps to run a vCenter Single Sign-On, Content Library or Tagging sample.
* run_sample.sh is needed for running the samples in UNIX/mac OS X environment
* run_sample.bat is a windows bat file needed for running the samples in windows

### API Documentation and Programming Guide
The API documentation for the samples can be found here : TODO

The programming guide for vSphere Automation SDK for Python can be found here:  TODO

## Submitting samples
The following information must be included in the README.md (TODO: header of the file or a separate md file?) for each submitted sample.
* Author Name
  * This can include full name, email address or other identifiable piece of information that would allow interested parties to contact author with questions.
* Date
  * Date the sample was originally written
* Minimal/High Level Description
  * What does the sample do ?
* vSphere version against which the sample was developed/tested
* SDK version against which the sample was developed/tested (TODO: do we need SDK version?)
* Python version against which the sample was developed/tested
* Any KNOWN limitations or dependencies

## Resource Maintenance
### Maintenance Ownership
Ownership of any and all submitted samples are maintained by the submitter.
### Filing Issues
Any bugs or other issues should be filed within GitHub by way of the repository’s Issue Tracker.
### Resolving Issues
Any community member can resolve issues within the repository, however only the board member can approve the update. Once approved, assuming the resolution involves a pull request, only a board member will be able to merge and close the request.

### VMware Sample Exchange
It is highly recommended to add any and all submitted samples to the VMware Sample Exchange:  <https://developercenter.vmware.com/samples>

Sample Exchange can be allowed to access your GitHub resources, by way of a linking process, where they can be indexed and searched by the community. There are VMware social media accounts which will advertise resources posted to the site and there's no additional accounts needed, as the VMware Sample Exchange uses MyVMware credentials.
